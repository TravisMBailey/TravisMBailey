/*Travis Bailey.

I am currently learning Cicode.
A programming language used by Citect and AVEVA Plant SCADA.

Based on the Pascal programming language but without pointers apparently.

I am using GitHub to document my progress and the small pieces of cicode i am required to create through my current position.
I also have access to alot of existing Cicode.
I will also be using Github to document this as i learn its funtion.

With roughly 50 results when searching Cicode on Github, 30 of them being irrelevant.
A functional database can only help people*/
